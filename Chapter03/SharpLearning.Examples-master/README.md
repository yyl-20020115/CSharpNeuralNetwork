SharpLearning.Examples
======================
![Build status](https://machinelearning.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/1bfe43f8-2f3d-449c-bc6e-2491e646764d/14/badge)

SharpLearning.Examples contains code examples to show how to use the machine learning library [SharpLearning](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning)

The examples are structured in a unittest project, where each test is a separate example. 
There are no assertions and the unit test framework is only used as an easy way of running the examples.
Information about how to get started can be found in the SharpLearning [wiki](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning/wiki)

An example showing how to read data, create a RegressionDecisionTreeLearner and learn a
RegressionDecisionTreeModel can be seen below:

```c#
[TestMethod]
public void RegressionLearner_Learn_And_Predict()
{
    // Use StreamReader(filepath) when running from filesystem
    var parser = new CsvParser(() => new StringReader(Resources.winequality_white));
    var targetName = "quality";

    // read feature matrix (all columns except quality)
    var observations = parser.EnumerateRows(c => c != targetName)
        .ToF64Matrix();

    // read regression targets
    var targets = parser.EnumerateRows(targetName)
        .ToF64Vector();

    // create learner
    var learner = new RegressionDecisionTreeLearner(maximumTreeDepth: 5);

    // learns a RegressionRandomForestModel
    var model = learner.Learn(observations, targets);

    // use the model to predict the training data
    var predictions = model.Predict(observations);
}
```

Currently there are only examples showing general usage of the learners and models. 
Specific examples for the individual learner/model types is planned. However, except from different hyperparameters,
the the individual learner types are used in exactly the same way. Same example as above but with a RandomForestLearner instead of a DecisionTreeLearner:


```c#
[TestMethod]
public void RegressionLearner_Learn_And_Predict()
{
    // Use StreamReader(filepath) when running from filesystem
    var parser = new CsvParser(() => new StringReader(Resources.winequality_white));
    var targetName = "quality";

    // read feature matrix (all columns except quality)
    var observations = parser.EnumerateRows(c => c != targetName)
        .ToF64Matrix();

    // read regression targets
    var targets = parser.EnumerateRows(targetName)
        .ToF64Vector();

    // create learner (RandomForest)
    var learner = new RegressionRandomForestLearner(trees: 100);

    // learns a RegressionDecisionTreeModel
    var model = learner.Learn(observations, targets);

    // use the model to predict the training data
    var predictions = model.Predict(observations);
}
```
